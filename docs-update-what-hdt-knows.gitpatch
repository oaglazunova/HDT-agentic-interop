+- which tools accessed them,
+- under which purpose (lane), and
+- with correlation IDs suitable for audit trails.
+

+# User-facing transparency agent: “What does the HDT know about me?”
+
+This repository includes an optional agent script that answers a user-centric question: **“What does the HDT know about me?”**
+
+It demonstrates that the same MCP tool surface used for integration and policy enforcement can also support **user-facing transparency**:
+
+This script is intentionally **LLM-free**: it is a deterministic report generator that uses MCP tools (data-access + telemetry) rather than natural-language reasoning.
+
+- The agent calls HDT **data-access tools** to discover or confirm what data streams exist for a subject (for example, walking records or diabetes-related self-reports).
+- It calls **telemetry tools** to retrieve an auditable trace of what was accessed, by which client, and for which purpose (lane).
+
+The output is a human-readable summary that can be used in a UI, a consent dialog, or a study audit report.
+
+## What the report includes
+
+1. **Data inventory**
+   - Which HDT domains/streams are configured or available (for example: walking, trivia, sugarvita).
+   - Where data is expected to come from (for example: vault vs live source), when provenance is available.
+
+2. **Recent access history**
+   - Tool name, timestamp, `client_id`, and `purpose` (lane).
+   - Policy outcome (allowed/denied) and relevant error codes.
+   - Correlation IDs (`corr_id`) to enable drill-down into a specific interaction.
+
+3. **Purpose breakdown**
+   - Counts of accesses per lane (coaching/analytics/modeling).
+   - “Unexpected” patterns (for example: repeated denials when a coaching client probes analytics-only tools).
+
+4. **Privacy notes**
+   - The report uses telemetry metadata only; it does not store or render raw payload logs.
+   - Optionally, telemetry can include a privacy-preserving `subject_hash` so the report can be scoped to a single subject without logging raw identifiers.
+
+## How to run
+
+From the repository root (after installing dependencies):
+
+### PowerShell
+
+```powershell
+$env:MCP_CLIENT_ID="TRANSPARENCY_AGENT"
+# Optional: add privacy-preserving subject_hash to telemetry records
+$env:HDT_TELEMETRY_SUBJECT_SALT="demo-salt"
+
+python scripts/demo_what_hdt_knows.py
+```
+
+### Git Bash / macOS / Linux
+
+```bash
+export MCP_CLIENT_ID="TRANSPARENCY_AGENT"
+export HDT_TELEMETRY_SUBJECT_SALT="demo-salt"  # optional
+
+python scripts/demo_what_hdt_knows.py
+```
+
+Notes:
+
+- The script is expected to call at least one data-access tool and then query telemetry (preferably via `hdt.telemetry.query.v1`; `hdt.telemetry.recent.v1` is a fallback).
+- If you run other demo scripts first (privacy/matrix), the report will also include those tool accesses.
+
+## Telemetry prerequisites
+
+The transparency agent relies on one of:
+
+- `hdt.telemetry.query.v1` (preferred; supports filtering)
+- `hdt.telemetry.recent.v1` (fallback; last N entries)
+
+To enable privacy-preserving per-subject linkage in telemetry, set:
+
+```
+HDT_TELEMETRY_SUBJECT_SALT=<stable secret salt>
+```
+
+When this variable is set, the gateway records `subject_hash` derived from `user_id` and the salt instead of persisting the raw `user_id` in telemetry.
+
+## Extending to a real HDT
+
+Recommended next steps for a user-facing HDT implementation:
+
+- Add a dedicated “inventory” tool that returns schema-level metadata per stream (types, time ranges, sources) without returning records.
+- Persist governance outputs as explicit telemetry events (for example: `transparency.report.generated`) to keep the audit trail end-to-end.
+- Expose the report to the user interface as a “data access ledger,” with filtering by purpose and time window.
+
+
+## Exploring the same tools in MCP Inspector
+
+You can reproduce the agent's key calls interactively in MCP Inspector. In the Tools panel, call:
+
+- `hdt.sources.status.v1` (inventory)
+- `hdt.walk.fetch.v1` (sample data-access, in a lane)
+- `hdt.telemetry.query.v1` (filtered audit trail)
+
+See `README.md` (Inspector section) for how to launch Inspector against `python -m hdt_mcp.gateway`.
